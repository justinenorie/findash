# Practicing NextJS by building a project dashboard

This project is a dashboard application built with NextJS. It is a part of my learning journey to practice and improve my skills in building web applications with NextJS.

The application is a simple project management dashboard that allows users to create, read, update, and delete projects.

I built this application to practice the following skills:

- Creating a NextJS application
- Setting up a database with Prisma
- Creating API routes with NextJS
- Using React Query to manage data fetching
- Using React Hook Form to manage form state
- Using Tailwind CSS for styling
- Using Heroicons for icons

I hope this project can be a helpful resource for anyone looking to learn more about building web applications with NextJS.
